I am a Ph.D. student in [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/main.htm) at Nanjing University and a member of [Reasoning & Learning Group](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/rl/index.htm), fortunately supervised by [Prof. Yinghuan Shi](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/shiyh/index.htm). My current research interests include semi-supervised learning, semi-supervised medical image segmentation, and domain adaptation.
